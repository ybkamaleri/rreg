These are the list for solutions implemented for the problems exist in thse commits
number. This means that the solutions can be found in the next commits of those in the list.

** 3d9a0f2
include expand=c(0,0) in scale_y_continuous()
** 8d47014
hjust=1 in geom_text and annotate
** 0360aa9
- ypos increase to 15% of max data$ylocal or data$ycomp so text doesn't overlap with
  max point.
- Decrease gaps between ylocal and ycomp
- Extend line for y-axis to 7% of max y
** bf07879
- ybreak is 0 when max y-axis below 25 and create problems for scale_y_continuous to
  define breaks from-to-by
- All max y-axis below 50 now given breaks to 5 points
